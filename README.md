# Stanford-University-DeepLearning.AI-Machine-Learning-Specialization

I see there are three courses in the Machine Learning Specialization:

**COURSE 1 - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**

In this course, you will learn the following:

Building machine learning models in Python using popular libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.

Creating and training supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks. This includes learning about linear regression and logistic regression techniques.

**COURSE 2 - Advanced Learning Algorithms**

In this course, you will learn the following:

Building and training neural networks using TensorFlow for multi-class classification tasks.

Applying best practices in machine learning development to ensure your models generalize well to real-world data and tasks.

Working with decision trees and tree ensemble methods, such as random forests and boosted trees.

**COURSE 3 - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

In the third course of the specialization, you will learn the following:

Utilizing unsupervised learning techniques for tasks like clustering and anomaly detection.

Building recommender systems using a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.

Constructing a deep reinforcement learning model.

These courses will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of various machine learning algorithms and techniques, allowing you to apply them to real-world problems effectively.
